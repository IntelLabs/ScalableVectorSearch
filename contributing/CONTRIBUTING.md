# How to Contribute

We would love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.

## Contribution process

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a
[Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) (CLA).
You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply
gives us permission to use, redistribute, and relicense your contributions.

There are two CLA versions, and which version needs to be signed depends on who owns the contribution being made:
- If the individual owns the contribution themselves, they can sign the [Individual CLA](CLA_individual.md).
The signature can be done directly when doing a pull request.
- If the contribution is owned by their employer, they need an [Entity CLA](CLA_entity.md).
    - **It's up to the contributor to know whether their work is owned by their employer or not.**
    - An Entity CLA must be signed by someone with signing authority for the entity (typically a director or higher, or a lawyer), and must also be reviewed by someone at Intel Corporation.
    - After signing it, please send it to us using one of the methods indicated in the CLA.

If you or your current employer have already signed our CLA, you probably don't need to do it again.
