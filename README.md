# Scalable Vector Search



**Scalable Vector Search (SVS)** is a performance library for vector [similarity search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_search).
Thanks to the use of Locally-adaptive Vector Quantization [[ABHT23]](#1) and its highly optimized indexing and search algorithms,
SVS provides vector similarity search:
* on **billions** of **high-dimensional** vectors,
* at **high accuracy**
* and **state-of-the-art speed**,
* while enabling the use of **less memory** than its alternatives.

This enables application and framework developers using similarity search to unleash its performance on Intel &reg; Xeon CPUs (2nd generation and newer).

SVS offers a fully-featured and yet simple Python API, compatible with most standard libraries.
SVS is written in C++ to facilitate its integration into performance-critical applications.

## Performance

SVS provides state-of-the-art performance and accuracy [[ABHT23]](#1) for billion-scale similarity search on
[standard benchmarks](https://intellabs.github.io/ScalableVectorSearch/benchs/index.html).

For example, for the standard billion-scale [Deep-1B](http://sites.skoltech.ru/compvision/noimi/) dataset,
different configurations of SVS yield significantly increased performance (measured in queries per second, QPS) with a smaller memory footprint (horizontal axis) than the alternatives[^1]:

SVS is primarily optimized for large-scale similarity search but it still offers [state-of-the-art performance
at million-scale](https://intellabs.github.io/ScalableVectorSearch/benchs/small_scale_benchs.html).

Best performance is obtained with 4th generation (Sapphire Rapids) by making use of AVX-512 instructions,
with excellent results also with 2nd and 3rd Intel &reg; Xeon &reg; processors (Cascade Lake
and Ice Lake).

Performance will be degraded if AVX-512 instructions are not available.
A warning message will appear when loading the SVS Python module if the system does not support
AVX-512 instructions.

## Key Features

SVS supports:
* Similarity functions: Euclidean distance, inner product, cosine similarity.
* Vectors with individual values encoded as: float32, float16, uint8, int8.
* Vector compression (including Locally-adaptive Vector Quantization [[ABHT23]](#1))
* Optimizations for Intel &reg; Xeon &reg; processors:
  - 2nd generation (Cascade Lake)
  - 3rd generation (Ice Lake)
  - 4th generation (Sapphire Rapids)

See [Roadmap](https://intellabs.github.io/ScalableVectorSearch/roadmap.html) for upcoming features.

## Documentation

[Our documentation](https://intellabs.github.io/ScalableVectorSearch/index.html) provides a reference of the library API, as well as several guides, tutorials,
and benchmark comparisons.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* A C++20 capable compiler:

    * GCC >= 11.0
    * Clang >= 13.0

To install the Python module you'll also need:

* Python >= 3.7
* A working internet connection

### Python build

To build and install the Python module, pysvs, clone the repo and run the following pip install command.

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IntelLabs/ScalableVectorSearch.git
cd ScalableVectorSearch

# Install pysvs using pip
CC=gcc-11 CXX=g++-11 pip install bindings/python
```

To uninstall, simply run
```
pip uninstall pysvs
```

If you encounter any issues with the pip install command, we suggest you follow an alternative installation procedure using
[cibuildwheel](<https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>). To generate a wheel using your current version of
Python you will need to have cibuildwheel installed as well as [docker](<https://www.docker.com/>).
Once those are installed, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the source and, if the ``bindings/python/_skbuild`` folder exists, remove it.

2. From the root directory of the source run

```
# Build the manylinux-based container needed by SVS
cd ./docker/x86_64/manylinux2014/
./build.sh
# Return the the root directory and run `cibuildwheel`
cd ../../..
cibuildwheel --only $(python tools/pybuild.py) bindings/python
```

3. Then simply run

```
pip install ./wheelhouse/pysvs*.whl
```

For more advanced building options see [Advanced Library Building](https://intellabs.github.io/ScalableVectorSearch/advanced/build.html).
